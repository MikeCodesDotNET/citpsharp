# citpsharp

A .Net library for implementing CITP (Controller Interface Transport Protocol) in any Windows-based application. The protocol allows transfer of status information, image thumbnails and streaming video frames between media servers, lighting desks and visualizers.

CitpSharp is in an early stage and has not yet reached a first release.

The library is LGPL licensed, allowing use in non-GPL-licensed projects. Any modifications to the source however must be given back to the community under the same license.
